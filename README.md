# Energy Demand vs Economic Indicators Pipeline

This project analyzes how energy consumption trends change alongside economic indicators such as unemployment rates using public US/EU datasets.

## Project Goal
The goal is to build a simple data pipeline that:
- Extracts public energy and economic data
- Cleans and aligns time-series data
- Stores the results in a SQL database
- Produces basic analytical insights

## Tech Stack
- Python
- SQL (MySQL)
- Airflow (for scheduling)

## Data Sources
- US Energy Information Administration (EIA): Monthly electricity consumption
- US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Monthly unemployment rate
